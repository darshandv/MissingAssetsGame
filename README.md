A scribbled 2D space shooter with orbital drifting and fun boss battles.

This game borrows from traditional arcade style space shooters but adds one fun and interesting core game mechanic: gravity. This game takes place in a scribble sheet of a bored kid in class. The player can orbit around celestial objects and use them to increase speed or to trap the enemies and kill them. The goal of the game is to complete each level by collecting all the collectibles, and most traditionally a deathmatch with the enemy shooters throughout the level. As players progress through the game they will find new abilities and shields with which they can strategize and develop unique play styles. Ultimately, the most fun component aims to be the gravity themselves as the player can make use of them in clever ways to make quicker work of the enemies.
